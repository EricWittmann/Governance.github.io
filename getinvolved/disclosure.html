<h1>Disclosure</h1>

<p>We'd like to make clear how this project works and who holds what responsibilities. We want everyone involved to
understand how decisions are made and where they can contribute. If you feel this page does not reflect the current
state of project ownership and responsibilities, please contact the team on <a href="/getinvolved/chat.html">IRC</a>
or the <a href="https://community.jboss.org/en/overlord/dev">Developer Forum</a>.</p>

<h2>Stewardship</h2>

<p>This project is developed and released by Red Hat with assistance from the Java developer community. The project lead
is appointed by Red Hat, and has the power to accept and reject contributions to the project and set the roadmap.
Red Hat employees assigned to work on Overlord as well as community contributors, in this regard, all answer to the
project lead.</p>

<h2>Requirement Definition</h2>

<p>The requirements and roadmap for Overlord are driven by Red Hat and by the community. Typically, when a major release
is being planned, the project lead will take input from both Red Hat and the community, and evaluate what can be done in
the necessary time. This will define what features will be addressed in a given release. The project lead will then
publish the roadmap on the <a href="https://community.jboss.org/en/overlord">User Forum</a> and
<a href="https://issues.jboss.org">Issue Tracker (JIRA)</a></p>

<p>Overlord is supported component of
<a href="http://www.redhat.com/products/jbossenterprisemiddleware/fuse-service-works/">Red Hat JBoss Fuse Service Works</a>
(FSW), so many requirements are often driven by FSW. You can download FSW for free from the
<a href="https://access.redhat.com/jbossnetwork/restricted/listSoftware.html?downloadType=distributions&product=jboss.fuse.serviceworks">
Red Hat customer portal.</a></p>

<p>The best way for you to suggest requirements for a future release of Overlord is to enter a feature request in
<a href="https://issues.jboss.org">JIRA</a>. Lobbying for features using the voting feature in
<a href="https://issues.jboss.org">JIRA</a>, and posting to the
<a href="https://community.jboss.org/en/overlord">User Forum</a>, is a great way to express interest as well.
Although, contributing is the single most expedient way to get a capability into a particular release.</p>

<h2>Release Cycle</h2>
<p>Overlord releases major (new features and API changes), minor (new features but no breaking API changes) and micro
releases (patches). Once a version of Overlord is included in a GA FSW release, Overlord moves on to it's next minor
version. If you are looking for a long term stream of patches, we recommend using
<a href="http://www.redhat.com/products/jbossenterprisemiddleware/fuse-service-works/">FSW</a></p>

<h2>Contribution</h2>
<p> Overlord welcomes, thrives on and greatly values community contribution, and makes the bar to contributing as low as
possible. If you have any questions on contributing, check out our
<a href="/getinvolved/contribute.html">guide to contributing</a>, then join us on
<a href="/getinvolved/chat.html">IRC</a> and speak to a member of the core Overlord team!</p>
