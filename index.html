                This component provides the capability to manage the lifecycle of systems from inception 
                through deployment through subsequent change management. A flexible workflow driven approach 
                is used to enable organizations to customize governance to fit the way they work.

                This component provides the infrastructure to capture service activity information and then
                correlate, analyse and finally present the information in a form that can be used by a 
                business to police Business/Service Level Agreements, and optimize their business.

                <h3>What is Overlord?</h3>
                <div class="project-description">
                  <p>
                    Any computer system, whether it is centralized or distributed, needs some form of governance, i.e., 
                    the act of monitoring and managing the system. Such governance may be as simple as ensuring only 
                    authorized users have access to capabilities (e.g. services), or as complex as guaranteeing the 
                    system and its components maintain a level of availability or reliability in the presence of 
                    failures or increased system load.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Managing distributed systems has always been a critical aspect 
                    for users, developers and administrators. As those distributed systems grew in scope and scalability, 
                    spanning multiple organizations with different infrastructures and trust boundaries, governance 
                    became more difficult but even more important. Governance deals with the processes by which a 
                    system operates. In order to have successful governance, some form of management, monitoring and 
                    administration is required for these processes.
